# TP_DevSecOps

## Overview

TP_DevSecOps is a comprehensive project designed to enhance your skills and knowledge in the fields of Development, Security, and Operations. This project provides a set of Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges that will help you to learn and apply various DevSecOps techniques and tools.

## CTF Challenges

The CTF challenges are the core of the TP_DevSecOps project. They are designed to test your skills in various areas of DevSecOps, including but not limited to:

- Secure coding practices
- Vulnerability assessment
- Threat modeling
- Security testing
- Incident response

Each challenge comes with a set of tasks that you need to complete in order to "capture the flag". The challenges are designed to be completed in order, with each one building on the knowledge and skills gained in the previous one.
